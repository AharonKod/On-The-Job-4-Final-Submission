      <div class="ContentBlock__SpaceAround-xtzbc9-2 juaRVd"><h2 id="life-as-a-foreigner" class="typography__Heading-sc-1xtvq8y-0 heEcbI">Life as a Foreigner</h2><h2 id="at-a-glance" class="typography__Heading-sc-1xtvq8y-0 heEcbI">At a Glance</h2><ul>
        <li>Miami has been rated the 5th most walkable city in the US.</li>
        <li>Considering only the city proper, Miami is the second most populated area in Florida. Jacksonville is the first.</li>
        <li>When people talk about Miami, they may be talking about Miami-Dade County, which is considerably larger than the city of Miami.</li>
        </ul><p>If you are relocating to Miami, you will want to know what it is like to live in the city. What are the practicalities of living there? Is it safe? Expensive? What are the pros and cons of living there?</p><h2 id="an-overview-of-life-in-miami" class="typography__Heading-sc-1xtvq8y-0 heEcbI">An Overview of Life in Miami</h2><p>Since its relatively recent founding in 1896, Miami has earned itself several nicknames: the Gateway to the Americas, the Capital of Latin America, The Cruise Capital of the World, and The Magic City. “The Magic City” came about because of the city’s rapid growth. It is no secret that a large amount of Florida’s population is made of retirees from the Northern and Midwestern United States. Each year when these retirees (termed “snowbirds” because of their propensity to migrate for winter) returned to Miami, they commented that the city’s growth was so rapid it seemed magical.</p><p>As a foreigner in Miami, you will quickly learn that there are very few native Miamians. In a population of nearly 500,000 residents in the Miami metropolitan area, it is estimated about 60% are born internationally. The city’s over 70% Latin population has earned it the nickname of “Capital of Latin America.” Nationals from Brazil, Cuba, Haiti, and Colombia have particularly large communities here. The Little Havana neighborhood is so prominent it even has its own official flag.</p><h2 id="the-miami-lifestyle" class="typography__Heading-sc-1xtvq8y-0 heEcbI">The Miami Lifestyle</h2><p>Miami’s lifestyle is largely dictated by two factors: the beach and its Latin population. As a coastal city, Miami runs on what is often termed “island time.” In Miami, this is called “Miami time.” Lifestyles and events do not run on the fast-paced, strict time schedule that you will see in other cities such as London or New York. When meeting people in Miami, do not be surprised if they show up late or, sometimes, not show up at all. “Miami time” is laidback and even forgetful at times. If you are stood up for a planned meet, do not be too offended. The longer you live in the city, the more likely you are to live on Miami time as well.</p><h2 id="miami-residents-active-and-social" class="typography__Heading-sc-1xtvq8y-0 heEcbI">Miami Residents: Active and Social</h2><p>Being beside the beach and having year-round warm weather, Miami residents are also very active. Going to the gym is a weekly, if not daily, activity for most Miamians. You will also see many people going for runs along the ocean or on the city sidewalks. This is because the weather promotes this type of activity and there is the ever-present expectation of having a “beach body.”</p><p>In addition to working out outside, Miami residents also socialize outside often. This means drinks and meals on outdoor patios, parties at the beach, or even a social event on a boat. Residents will also duck inside often for a blast of cool air-conditioned air, but on average Miamians like to be outside enjoying their home’s pleasant weather.</p><h2 id="the-latin-influence" class="typography__Heading-sc-1xtvq8y-0 heEcbI">The Latin Influence</h2><p>Given the large Latin population, much of Miami’s lifestyle is also influenced by the blending of different South American cultures. For example, while a simple handshake greeting is common throughout most of the US, in Miami you may receive a peck on the cheek greeting. There is also no shortage of Latin music and dance clubs, and lively cultural celebrations such as Carnival.</p><p>If you are a Spanish speaker, you will feel right at home in Miami. While walking around the city’s streets, you are just as likely to hear this language spoken as you are to hear English. Likewise, if you would like to learn Spanish, Miami is an ideal location to practice your skills as the entire city is practically bilingual.</p><h2 id="what-does-it-cost-to-live-in-miami-" class="typography__Heading-sc-1xtvq8y-0 heEcbI">What Does it Cost to Live in Miami?</h2><p>Is it expensive to live in Miami? Yes and no. The cost of living in Miami is high, but not so high as when compared to other US cities such as <a href="https://www.internations.org/los-angeles-expats/guide/living-short">Los Angeles</a> or <a href="https://www.internations.org/new-york-expats/guide/living-short">New York</a>. Miami is the 13th most expensive city in North America, and the 28th most expensive in the world.</p><p>The cost of living is influenced mostly by high housing prices, but this is balanced by Florida’s lack of a state income tax. Therefore, Miami residents will find themselves paying a high price for housing but keeping more of their paycheck than they would if they lived in any other US state.</p><p>The cost of living in Miami is also different than other major US cities such as <a href="https://www.internations.org/new-york-expats/guide/moving-to-short">New York</a> and <a href="https://www.internations.org/chicago-expats/guide/moving-to-short">Chicago</a> in that residents do not have to spend a lot of money in order to go out to eat or take in a cultural experience. For example, while the cost for a dinner for two in Miami Beach could easily run 50-80 USD, a night out in an inland neighborhood could also be as cheap as 20-30 USD.</p><p>Here is a look at some of the average costs you can expect when living in Miami:</p><h2 id="housing-and-living" class="typography__Heading-sc-1xtvq8y-0 heEcbI">Housing and Living</h2><p><strong>Item</strong>
        <strong>USD</strong>
        Monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment

        1.80</p><h2 id="the-pros-and-cons-of-living-in-miami" class="typography__Heading-sc-1xtvq8y-0 heEcbI">The Pros and Cons of Living in Miami</h2><p>On average, the standard of living throughout Miami is high although there are a few neighborhoods that are known for extreme poverty. There are also “shantytowns,” which are homeless communities erected under and on top of freeway bridges and overpasses. Read on to learn if living in the Magic City is right for you.</p><h2 id="is-it-safe-" class="typography__Heading-sc-1xtvq8y-0 heEcbI">Is it Safe?</h2><p>When compared to other US cities such as Chicago, LA, or Atlanta, Miami is generally safe. In the past, Miami had the reputation of a fairly dangerous city. Street muggings happened daily, and it was even common for a carjacking to occur in a crowded area in broad daylight. However, in recent years, Miami has become increasingly safe. Carjacking and gang violence are rare, and the greatest threat will be pickpocketing and scams.</p><p>Like any major city, Miami has areas that are very safe and areas to avoid. The areas that Miami locals consider unsafe are:</p><ul>
        <li>Liberty City;</li>
        <li>Overtown;</li>
        <li>Little Haiti;</li>
        <li>stretches of Ocean Drive on South Beach (particularly between 8th and 11th street).</li>
